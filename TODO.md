# TODO

## Potential

- [x] create a minifier wrapper type, so we can provide a better interface?
- [x] parseTemplateGlob might do well to be made more customisable so we can attatch funcs in a more sensible way?
- [x] version type + version comparison functions?
- [x] PageData feels like a redundant abstraction, considering removing it (what do we replace it with?)
